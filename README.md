# Project-2
## OBJECTIVE: Understand historical CO2 emission trends by nation.
 
More than ever consumers are demanding their products & services minimize pollution harmful to our planet. 
Companies like Microsoft, Starbucks, Adidas, and Jetblue have all made carbon neutral commitments in the next 5-10 years. 
As we learn through the data (and you can too), emissions spiked after major global events such as WW2, the Great Depression, and the Great Recession as governments spurned regulations and businesses increased production to support economic growth. 

As a result of public measures to tame COVID-19, researchers are projecting fossil fuel emissions to be down 8% globally in 2020. While a positive development on its own, with an understanding of the historical trends it's apparent there's risk in this event as well. 
There isnâ€™t a more important time to prioritize clean energy as businesses re-open and the economy starts back up.

## Industrial Powers over Time , USA CHINA U.K

Emissions have generally increased over time, with minor decreased emissions around WW2 in 1944 and the financial crisis of 2009. Coming out of both instances emissions increased again.

The industrialization of China is evident in the emissions growth from 1950 to 2014 (most recent year of available data).

Despite a growing population, the UK has not substantially grown emissions relative to the US and China
