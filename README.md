# Project-2
## OBJECTIVE 

Understand the history of emissions by nation. 
More than ever consumers are demanding their products & services minimize pollution harmful to our planet. 
Companies like Microsoft, Starbucks, Adidas, and Jetblue have all made carbon neutral commitments in the next 5-10 years. 
As we learn through the data (and you can too), coming out of WW2 & both major financial crises emissions spiked as businesses increased production to support economic growth. 
Due to public measures taken to tame COVID-19, researchers are projecting fossil fuel emissions to be down 8% globally in 2020. 
There isn’t a more important time to prioritize clean energy as businesses re-open and the economy starts back up.

## Industrial Powers over Time , USA CHINA U.K

Emissions have generally increased over time with minor decreased emissions around WW2 in 1944 and the financial crisis of 2009. Coming out of both instances emissions increased.

The industrialization of China is evident in the growth from 1950 to 2014.

Despite a growing population, the UK has not substantially grown emissions relative to the US and China
